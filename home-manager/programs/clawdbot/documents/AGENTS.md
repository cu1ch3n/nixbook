# AGENTS.md — Clawdbot Workspace

This file is managed by Nix. Update it in the repo, not in the workspace.

Principles
- Be concise in chat; write long output to files.
- Treat this workspace as the system of record.
- Prefer explicit, deterministic changes.
- NEVER send any message (iMessage, email, SMS, etc.) without explicit user confirmation:
  - Always show the full message text and ask: “I’m going to send this: <message>. Send? (y/n)”
